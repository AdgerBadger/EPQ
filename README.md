# Planning

## Ideas:

- **Symphonic piece?**
- Maybe across different time periods/genres? (concerto through time lol)
- Modern/Epic?
- **EP Q (Funny name, also very flexible)**

### Symphonic Piece
This would be a multiple movement piece of orchestral music, probably in the style of [Romantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_music) and 20th century orchestral works. This affords lots of flexibility in terms of instrumentation, structure, harmony and melody. Since this kind of music has always been something I find very interesting, I would very much enjoy to write the piece. Additionally, it would allow me to learn more about woodwind and brass instruments, as well as orchestral percussion, which are areas I do not have much experience writing music in.

#### Features
- Flexible composition structure
- Harmonic and modal variety
- Large scale
- Instrumental (Orchestral)
- Challenging, with restrictions and requirements on instrumentation.

#### Skills Development
- Learning about Brass instruments, and how to write for them
- Learning about Woodwind instruments, and how to write for them
- Learning about Orchestral Percussion, and how to incorporate it into pieces
- Further learning about the historical and cultural context of Romantic and 20th Century music

### EP Q
This would be a modern alternative rock EP (Extended Play). Similarly, it has lots of flexibility, as the alternative genre is very wide and diverse, including everything from Mike Oldfield to Pink Floyd. However, its lack of defined structure can make planning it hard, and chords and harmony are generally more restrictive, as this is a genre related to rock. However, it makes up for this in instrumentation, as every instrument is fair game, which gives large variety. This would consist of about 15 minutes worth of tracks, so probably around 5, which play back to back and fade into each other.

#### Features
- Flexible composition structure
- Instrumental and lyrical variety

# Adger Badger Lore
Adger Badger is a mythical creature, said to be a super intelligent badger of a furry disposition. Nothing much is known this legendary creature, and its existence is a hotly debated and controversial topic among Badgrologists.
